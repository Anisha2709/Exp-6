# Exp - 6 STUDENT ONLINE EXAM REGISTRATION SYSTEM

# AIM:
To model the exam slot booking system using UML diagrams in StarUML.

# SRS (Procedure):
### Step 1: Problem Identification  
Identify challenges in manual exam slot booking such as scheduling conflicts, room allocation errors, and lack of real-time availability tracking.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis  
Define user roles (Student, Admin) and core functions: login authentication, room selection, view available slots, book slot, enter exam details, and confirm booking.

### Step 3: System Design  
Create UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, Package) in StarUML and design database tables for students, rooms, time slots, and bookings.
